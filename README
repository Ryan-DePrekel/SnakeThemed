Snake Themed Game for Computer Club Contest

Top Down Shooter built in Love2D

To Build:
    First install Love2D on your machine
        http://love2d.org

    On Linux Distros you can run the game by running:
        >love SnakeThemed.love

        There are nifty packages I found within Atom that allow you to run through
        the text editor.
    On Windows
        Click and drag the project directory onto the LOVE2D launcher
        I'm sure you can also execute it via the CMD but I don't build
        under Windows so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    There would be an executable if i felt it deserved one but alas it is
    very lacking.

Note:
    Game is very incomplete and more is to come. Currently everything is a
    square (whoops) and enemies just walk toward the player and you can shoot them

    Controls:
        WASD to move, arrow keys to fire

To-Do:
    Add a clear objective to the game (duh)
        -Kill the snake enemies to defend them from your house?
        -Currently 'Snakes' just walk at player
    Add sprites for the snakes, player, etc.
    Add scoreboard
    Add UI/HUD
    Create power-ups
    Add a menu
